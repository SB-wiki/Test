# Storage account Migrations and refactoring


Its Great to know that  **we donâ€™t have 1500+ variables but only 14 variables now in sunbird, related to storage accounts**  like name, keys, sas in the ansible code and no cross reference apart from container details. 


## Create 2 storage Accounts for private application contents and one management account to store backups and other devops related code, Don't touch the storage account with public contents and druid contents.
\* Follow the below naming convention to create storage account, NOTE: organisation and env are variables

{{organisation}}{{env}}management

{{organisation}}{{env}}private

\* Create a generic storage account for all the environments to store build artifacts for jenkins, this is a one time activity for all the environments in a particular organisation.

{{organisation}}artifact

\* Keep the druid storage account and key as and make sure the container is private

\* Remove all the reference variables related to storage account from CORE/KnowledgePlaform/DataPipeline[Common.yml/Secrets.yml] from the private github repo.


*  Migrate the storage containers across storage accounts \[container with private ACL to be in private storage account, public should left as is]as per the design document\[[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S5ivpL4DerR4i0YIPkms17K6wv0Y9uf5rguSVB_2_d8/edit#gid=1341452876%5D](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S5ivpL4DerR4i0YIPkms17K6wv0Y9uf5rguSVB_2_d8/edit#gid=1341452876%5D)


* Generate SAS token for management, public, artifacts and private storage account with CRUD operations
