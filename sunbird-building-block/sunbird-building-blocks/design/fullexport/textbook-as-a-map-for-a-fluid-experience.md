# Textbook-as-a-Map----for-a-fluid-experience

(Parking some thoughts on this metaphor here).

Consider a Textbook as a map (as in a geographic map) for a moment.  Every learning services is then actually a location-based, location-aware Service. For example,

In a (Google) Map, we can ask for

1. Find restaurants near-by
2. Find the shortest route from A to B
3. Find a shopping mall near by
4. Book an Uber
5. etc...

If we treat Textbook as a Map, one can ask for

1. Find teaching material for \*
2. Find practicing  material for \*
3. Find previous exam questions for \*
4. Give me a curiosity question for \*
5. Tell me how others are doing in _\*_
6. Tell me what others are facing difficulty with \*
7. What is best way I can go from here (concept) to another (next chapter)

What benefits do we see:

1. It unifies the design across all verticals in Sunbird Ed. It is like building an Uber, an Ola, a Swiggy, on the top of Google Maps.It is going to be the same interface
2. Lessens the burden of providing exact location details (Taxonomy terms) by non-expert Users
3. In order to ask for services, a user does not need provide exact address (like house number, street name, nearest landmark, pin code). He simply drops a pin. Likewise, A user simply select a kindle like Textbook from the library (by supplying just four fields â€“ board, medium, grade, subject) and start browsing it. User need bother about choosing Chapter, Topic or anything of that sort.
4. A User implicitly provides "learning location" implicitly to the system as he/she is browsing the Textbook. The current location on the kindle-like book, gives away the exact details.
5. At this time, Users are using Taxonomy terms as pointers and pointers only. Even though, we are calling them Taxonomies, they are just pointers to Content in a physical Textbook.
6. But in the platform, these pointers also expected to contain the "meaning" as well. In that sense, pointers are overloaded with responsibility. With Textbook as a Map metaphor, we don't have to have to ask for the pointers explicitly. Location (Concept and Context) are implicitly provided. All the complexity can be handled by the backend to figuring out the meaning of the location. It simple outside but complex inside.
7. Providing resources in one medium to another medium, is like transforming cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates. User always remains in their own zone.

What are the challenges:

1. The reference Textbooks are not standard. Unlike Google Maps, which is the default, standard map, every school can follow a different Textbook. May be Users can just scan Textbook, instead of loading a reference digital Textbook.
2. The Textbook browser (kindle like Textbook) viewer that can compute location has to be developed.
