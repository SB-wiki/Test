# Teacher-and-Student-Enablement-through-Textbook

### Value for each persona (JTBD)

Refer to EPIC: [SB-11947 System JIRA](https://browse/SB-11947)

**Vision** : To enable teachers to be able to teach in a better way, and students to understand topics in a better way & prepare for exams.

**Goal** : Provide access to resources to enable teachers (to teach) and students (to understand topics, prepare for exams) by providing a bouquet of resources.

To enable better teacher preparation, provide&#x20;

1. Lesson Plans: Engage students in a systematic way with variety of teaching ideas
2. Curiosity Questions: Pique studentsâ€™ interest while initiating a new chapter
3. Focus Spots: Explain confusing topics in an easy manner
4. Learning Outcome Definition: Know expected outcomes of the chapter
5. Marking Scheme Rubric: Know scoring rules and weightage for the chapter

Additionally a teacher may also find useful

1. Explanation resource: Refresh my own concepts and Explain concepts better
2. Experiential resource: Get students to relate better to the topic through real-life application
3. Practice Q-A Sets: Give diverse practice beyond textbook

**Objective** : These resources can be provided in a well organised manner by leveraging textbook on Sunbird. A textbook containing these resources would be structured as below

* Textbook
  * Chapter 1 (Topic 1)
  * Teach
  * Lesson Plan
  * Curiosity Questions
  * Focus Spot
  * Learning Outcome Definition
  * Marking Scheme Rubric
  * Learn
  * Explanation resource
  * Experiential resource
  * Practice
  * Multiple Choice Question Practice Set
  * .. (other practice sets)
  * Chapter 2 (Topic 2)
  * ..
  * Chapter n (Topic n)

Enable teachers and students to engage with a textbook using a variety of resources. Some of the possible JTBDs for a teacher, student, or parent are

![Value for a senior student](<../../../../PRD/prd-ed-td-req-1ts/images/storage/CBSE Launch\_Value 3.jpg>)

![Value for an experienced teacher](<../../../../PRD/prd-ed-td-req-1ts/images/storage/CBSE Launch\_Value 1.jpg>)

![Value for a young teacher](<../../../../PRD/prd-ed-td-req-1ts/images/storage/CBSE Launch\_Value 2.jpg>)

![Value for a middle school student](<../../../../PRD/prd-ed-td-req-1ts/images/storage/CBSE Launch\_Value 4.jpg>)

![Value for a parent (mother)](<../../../../PRD/prd-ed-td-req-1ts/images/storage/CBSE Launch\_Value 5.jpg>)

#### Resources to enable JTBDs

To deliver these values, following types of resources can be made available using Textbook in SunbirdEd

![](<../../../../PRD/prd-ed-td-req-1ts/images/storage/CBSE Launch\_Value Resources.png>)

### Workflow for creation programmes

A SunbirdEd adopter tenant wants to crowdsource content from its users (primarily teachers) for teacher & student enablement.

Admin of a program will ensure that following things are in place

1. Taxonomy framework including Learning Objectives mapped to Topics
2. Users with required permission rights for Administration, Creation, and Review
3. Program ID is created

For programs portal, following setup needs to be done

1. Content Types: This program supports only Practice Set creation, review, publishing, and linking to textbooks.
2. Textbooks for Contribution: Create textbooks on SunbirdEd textbook editor and link them to a program ID
3. Participating Teams (Schools): Setup list of Schools for program portal
4. Publishing and Linking logic: Build logic as per predefined textbook structure. Current logic supports textbook structured as \[ Textbook > Level 1 Unit (Chapter) > Level 2 Unit (Question Bank) > .. ]. All Practice Sets published are linked to 'Question Bank' folder if it is present at Level 2 Unit
5. Question Types & Categories: Question types - mcq, reference; Question categories - vsa, sa, la, mcq
6. Roles: Program portal supports 3 roles - Contributor, Reviewer, Publisher

Contributor onboarding

1. First time sign-in / sign-up with Google will grant Contributor role
2. On first time sign-in, the user needs to select onboarding details (B, M, C, S) and School

Contribution Workflow

1. Sign-in with Google
2. Select Class & Subject
3. Select Textbook
4. Select Chapter. Only Textbook Level 1 Unit which are linked to topic are shown as "Textbook Unit Name (Topic)"
5. For each chapter, contributor can see Total, Created by Me, Needs Attention
6. Select Question Category to start creating questions
7. Question creation page is open with empty form for first question to be created. User can Preview or Submit the question.
   1. User cannot Save questions. If user goes back without submitting, the question is cleared / lost.
8. Select Learning Outcome for the question. Learning Outcomes only for current selected chapter (topic) are shown.
9. Select Learning Level for the question
