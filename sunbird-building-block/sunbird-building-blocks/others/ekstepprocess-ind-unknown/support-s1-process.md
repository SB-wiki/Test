## Exceptions&#x20;

The Exceptions to this process is outlined below:

1. Triage calls will happen during the working hour over the weekdays and the next morning if the issue is identified post working hours.
2. Triage calls over the weekend will be subject to availability of the participants else the call will be conducted on the next working day for all.
3. This process does not capture the closure of the Jira Ticket (It is subject to RCA done on the issue)
4. The S1 coordinator, L2 Support Lead and Engineering Coordinator have no votes during the Triage Call. They will just provide the qualifying information and gather inputs.
5. There will be a max of 5 folks on the triage group(excluding the coordinators). It is only their vote that will count in deciding whether the S1 ticket is indeed an S1. The representation will be from:
   * Minimum of 3 participants required to attain a quorum.

## Process Metrics

The process metrics are as follows:

1. % accuracy on the rubric followed by L2 Support (% of instances NOT moved down from a S1 to S2 bucket post triage)- Should be greater than 80% (L2 Metric)
2. % variance on ETA provided during the Triage process. Variance should not be greater than 10% (L3 Metric)
